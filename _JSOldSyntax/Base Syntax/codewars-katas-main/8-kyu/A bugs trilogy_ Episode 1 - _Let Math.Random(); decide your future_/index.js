  Description:
    Our friend Pac has finally decided to pursue a career in the coding industry.
    He is a newbie, he needs to learn properly.
    Therefore, Pac wants to apply for the worldwide famous -and very demanding-

    In order to join, Pac is required to solve a series of 3 exercises about 'Bug Fixes'.
    He has been sent an email from the Academy with the following instructions,

    Dear Pac,
    This is the first exercise. Find out what's wrong and fix the code.
    You have 15 minutes to send a solution.
    Good Luck.

// Long Solution
/*
const yourFutureCareer = (career = Math.random()) => {
  if (career <= 0.32) return 'FrontEnd Developer'
  else if (career <= 0.65) return 'BackEnd Developer'
  return 'Full-Stack Developer'
}
*/

// Short Solution
const yourFutureCareer = (career = Math.random()) =>
  `${
    career <= 0.32 ? 'FrontEnd' : (career <= 0.65 ? 'BackEnd' : 'Full-Stack')
  } Developer`

// Function Export
module.exports = yourFutureCareer
