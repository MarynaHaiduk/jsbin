// Long Solution
/*
const animalYears = (humanYears, animal) => {

  return years
}

  humanYears,
  animalYears(humanYears, 'cat'),
  animalYears(humanYears, 'dog'),
]
*/

// Short Solution
const humanYearsCatYearsDogYears = humanYears => [
  humanYears,
  (humanYears - 1 ? 16 : 11) + 4 * humanYears,
  (humanYears - 1 ? 14 : 10) + 5 * humanYears,
]
